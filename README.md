# 🪦 GraveWarden
**Seamless item protection. Secure, lightweight, essential.**

GraveWarden is a modern, zero-command death management solution for Paper/Spigot servers. It focuses on a "plug-and-play" experience, protecting your items through an advanced soul-retrieval system without bloating your server with unnecessary commands or dependencies.

## ✨ Key Features

* **📦 Smart Slot Restoration:** GraveWarden remembers your exact inventory layout. It restores items precisely where they were (Hotbar, Armor slots, and Off-hand) upon retrieval.
* **🛡️ Overflow Protection:** If your inventory is full when opening a grave, excess items are safely dropped at your feet. Zero item loss guaranteed.
* **👻 Standalone Holograms:** Aesthetic player-head graves with floating text. No external APIs (like DecentHolograms) required—it works perfectly out of the box.
* **🌌 Soul Particle Effects:** A striking visual "Soul" burst triggers when you reclaim your items, providing high-quality feedback.
* **🚀 Native 1.20.6+ Support:** Fully optimized using modern Data Components and Persistent Data Containers (PDC) for maximum stability on the latest Minecraft versions.

## 📖 How it Works

1. **Death:** A grave is automatically created at your death location with your player head.
2. **Hologram:** A floating display shows the owner's name and the time of death.
3. **Recovery:** Simply **Right-Click** your grave. Your items will fly back into their original slots instantly.
4. **Cleanup:** Once the items are retrieved, the grave and the hologram vanish automatically.
